	- algorithm overview
	- debris arrival behavior
	- processing scheme
	- prototype
	- performance evaluation

weak points
	- location data is not mentioned
	- no analyses of cost of link estimation itself
	- how frequently is the link estimaiton done ? 
		- its unknown if there is debris, and how often it should offload
	- comparison between debris detection algoritms is missings
	- hybrid processing is not taking into account the time it takes to transmit
		the data back to the phone
	- it's missing what to do once debris is detected! 
	- what if two piles of debris are seen?
		
improvements	
	- 3g 4g is only available in urban areas, what to do once at sea? 
	- it doesn't clean, only detects debris
	- using gyroscope for aligning images. 
	- what happens if battery is nearly done? 
	- what happens if robot is stuck in debris?
	- deploy in rough water
	
realtion to our project
	- implement image recognition
	- set communication with cloud offloading
