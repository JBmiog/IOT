Introduction
Our project aims to recognise and track a car by clicking a picture of its number plate. This is super convenienet if you are waiting for you cab to arrive. This 


considerations
1) Trade-off if we are going to do the image recognition of the license plate on the mobile phone or
on a server
2) which algorithms are we going to use for extracting the license plate information.
3) how to make a connection with the server (3g/4g/wifi) 

tasks
1) make the android application which can be used to:
	- spot a car.
	- upload the data. 
	- receive information about car history.
	- display this data to the user.
2) facilitate communication between smartphone and server
3) implement the license plate recognition

succes criteria
1) data is sent to the cloud
2) Data is succesfully processed 
3) smartphone user is receiving feedback:
	- was the picture clear enough to process succesfull?	
	- probability of direction.
	- timestamp of previous succesfull sighting.
	- frequency of car being spotted.
